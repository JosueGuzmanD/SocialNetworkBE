## **Design Patterns and Principles**

### **1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

The system follows a **DDD-centric approach** aligned with the football domain. Core domain concepts are represented through main entities such as **Player**, **Match**, **Team**, and **FootballField**.

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Common terminology is used throughout the codebase, such as "Player" instead of "User" to reflect football-related contexts.
- **Aggregate Pattern**: Related entities are grouped under aggregates, like **Match**, which contains **Players** and **Match statistics**.
- **Value Objects**: These objects, such as `UserStats` and `MatchDuration`, encapsulate specific behaviors and ensure immutability.

### **2. SOLID Principles**

The design adheres to **SOLID principles** for maintainable, scalable, and extensible code:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each entity or service has a single responsibility. For example, `MatchService` only manages match-related logic.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification, leveraging Value Objects and aggregate patterns.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes can substitute their base classes without altering system behavior.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Small, specific interfaces are created, avoiding general ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level classes depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than low-level classes.
