## **System Overview**

This platform is a **social network** dedicated to organizing and managing **football matches**. Players can:

- Create profiles
- Form teams
- Schedule matches
- Book football fields
- Interact through posts and comments
- Track personal and team stats

The system employs **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles, representing key football-related concepts through entities, Value Objects, and domain services that manage business logic. We use patterns like **aggregates** to group related entities and **Value Objects** to handle specific behaviors and immutable values.
